We have multiple different loops in JS:
1. for loops
2. while loops
3. do-while loops

In addition we have 2 new one here: These are mainly used to iterate on some special datatypes
1. for-of loops: on Strings and Arrays 
2. for-in loops: on Objects
Usage - for(char of String); for(key in Object)
In these loops we need not take care of anything related to iterating variables like - creating it, updating it and stopping condition on it. They are all automatically taken care off



Strings:
How do we create them? Just like vraibles using var, let and const. But the value assigned is String, so that is when the type is decided.
How do we access String value? using its name
How do we access individual characters? 1. using index and 2. using for-of loop
What is template literal in Strings? Technique to insert variable values in String using `(backticks) and $(dollar)
methods: toUpperCase(); toLowerCase(); trim(); slice(); concat(); replace(); charAt();
