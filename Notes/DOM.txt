console.log() vs console.dir(): console log of any node prints its HTML structure while dir prints object structure which includes html children nodes as well

Some notable elements of object structure of HTML node:
attributes, childElementCount, childNodes, children, firstChild, firstElementChild, lastChild, lastElementChild, id, innerHTML, lang, nodeName, nodeValue, 
parentElement, parentNode, style, tagName, textContent

Window object - It represent an open window in a browser. It is a browser's object and not Javascript object. It is automatically created by the browser
                It is a global object with lots of roperties and methods. ex. console.log(); console.dir(); alert(); prompt() 

DOM - It is way to access HTML code using Javascript. Using this you can make dynamic change to your website at the Run-time.

All the HTML elements can be accessed from Javascript using "Document" object. We can delete existing elements and also create elements that do not already exist.
Note: Even though we have HTML in the DOM tree we can directly access head and body using - document.body and document.head (Interesting and remember)

We can access any element of HTML using any of the 2 ways:
1. document.getElement/s(): document.getElementById("idName"), document.getElementsByClassName("className"), document.getElementsByTagName(tagName)
2. document.querySelector(): document.querySelector(#id/.name/tag), document.querySelectorAll(#id/.name/tag)
As per me, I would prefer using querySelector, wanna know why, then test it in browser. Its o/p is easily understandable.


Some properties:
1. tagName - returns tag for element nodes.
2. innerText - returns only the text content of the element and all of its children
3. innerHTML - returns the HTML contents of the element in the textual format
4. textContent - This is similar to innerHTML. Additionally it displays hidden HTML nodes as well.


childNodes vs children:
childNodes has three types of Nodes - Text nodes, HTML element nodes and cpmment node. Return type NodeList
while children represents HTML elements/Nodes only, so I guess it is better to use "children" than to use "childNodes". Return type HTMLCollection


Attributes: To access as well as modify attributes of a node
1. getAttribute(attr) - To get the value of an attribute
2. setAttribute(attr, val) - To set the value of an attribute

Style: To access existing styling elements as well as modify styling
Node.style

Create an element in JS:
document.createElement();

Insert Elements: 
1. node.append(element) - Add an element inside the node at the end of it. 
2. node.prepend(element) - Add an element inside the node at the beginning of it.
3. node.before(element) - Add an element before a node
4. node.after(element) - Add an element after a node

Delete Element:
Node.remoove() - Removes the node
